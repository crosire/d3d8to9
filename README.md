[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/aqupdda60ixgenyd?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/crosire/d3d8to9)

This is a pseudo-driver module that intends to improve compatibility and stability in games using Direct3D 8 for rendering by converting all API calls and low-level shaders to equivalent Direct3D 9 ones. By that it also opens those games to new possibilities from proven modding tools written for Direct3D 9, including [ReShade](http://reshade.me).

## Building

You'll need Visual Studio 2013 or higher to build d3d8to9. It is recommended to install the old standalone DirectX end-user runtime, which is required for the D3DX libraries used for disassembling and assembling the shaders.

A quick overview of what some of the source code files contain:
